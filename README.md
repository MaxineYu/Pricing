Author Contributions Checklist Form
This form documents the artifacts associated with the article (i.e., the data and code supporting the computational findings) and describes how to reproduce the findings.

Part 1: Data
☐ This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).

☒ I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.
Abstract 

The dataset includes information about all approved loan applications from July 2002 through November 2004. This consists of 208,085 records of which 45,787 (22%) have resulted in loans. Because loan offers expired in 45 days, the “fate” of unused loans approved in the final 45 days of the data is unknown.

☐ All tables and figures in the paper
☐ Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified here:




Workflow details
Format(s) 
☒ Single master code file 
☐ Wrapper (shell) script(s)
☐ Self-contained R Markdown file, Jupyter notebook, or other literate programming approach
☐ Text file (e.g., a readme-style file) that documents workflow
☐ Makefile
☐ Other (more detail in 'Instructions' below)
Instructions
The ‘regret_compute’ folder contains the codes for computing our regret under different smoothness conditions. These files reproduce the results corresponding to Figure 1, Figure 7-8, Figure 9-Figure 11. If the file name contains "/indp/dp/mix-m2/m4/m6", they correspond to our indp/dp/mix settings(described on page 25 of our manuscript) with independent/dependent/strong-mixing entries with the degree of smoothness 2/4/6 respectively.

The ‘regret_compare’ folder contains the codes for comparing our method with respective to other methodolgy. Corresponds to figure 2 and 3. To be more specific, the folder named ‘Simulation’ under ‘regret_compare’ contains codes for reproducing figure 2 with different degree of smoothness (m=2/4/6). The folder ‘Real_data’ contains our post processed data (.csv) and the performance of our algorithm compared to `RMLP-2’ and `Bandit’ algorithm respectively.  





Expected run-time

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard desktop machine:
☐ <1 minute 
☐ 1-10 minutes
☐ 10-60 minutes
☐ 1-8 hours
☒ >8 hours
☐ Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described here:
